    "steps": [
        {
            "step_number": 1,
            "mathematical_step": "Original expression: x^{2} - 5 x + 6",
            "explanation": "This step shows: Original expression: x^{2} - 5 x + 6. Each step helps us work towards finding the answer.",
            "concept": "Mathematical step"
        },
        {
            "step_number": 2,
            "mathematical_step": "Factored form: \\left(x - 3\\right) \\left(x - 2\\right)",
            "explanation": "This step shows: Factored form: \\left(x - 3\\right) \\left(x - 2\\right). Each step helps us work towards finding the answer.",
            "concept": "Mathematical step"
        }
    ],
    "final_answer": "x**2 - 5*x + 6"
}
```

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Correctly factored quadratic: (x-3)(x-2)

## Known Limitations

1. OpenAI explanations require API key (falls back to basic explanations)
2. Currently supports algebraic expressions only
3. No user authentication yet (planned for v1.1)
4. No rate limiting (planned for v1.2)

---

## Recommendations for Production

1. ✅ Add OpenAI API key for better explanations
2. ✅ Deploy to Vercel (frontend) and Fly.io (backend)
3. ⚠️ Implement rate limiting
4. ⚠️ Add monitoring/logging (Sentry recommended)
5. ⚠️ Set up CI/CD pipeline
6. ⚠️ Add comprehensive test suite
