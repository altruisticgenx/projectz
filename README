# 👋 Hi — I’m Inga

Engineer, security researcher, and systems architect building human-first AI and decentralized systems that scale.

I design and ship production-ready ML and governance systems that prioritize privacy, resilience, and real‑world impact. My work blends large‑language‑model engineering, decentralized architecture, red‑team rigor, and federal program optimization — all guided by product sensibilities and measurable outcomes.

## Snapshot
- Location: Philadelphia, PA (Hybrid / Remote)  
- Roles: Machine Learning Engineer · Systems Architect · Security Researcher · Federal Consultant  
- Approach: Human-centered design · Security-first engineering · Outcome-driven delivery

## What I build (one line)
AI-native systems and governance primitives that empower users, reduce operational risk, and unlock measurable efficiencies.

## Core strengths
- LLM integration & production ML (GPT + open-source models)  
- Decentralized systems & digital governance design  
- Penetration testing, threat emulation & security hardening  
- Federal program optimization, compliance, and stakeholder coordination  
- Product strategy, systems architecture, and operationalization

---

## Impact highlights
- Built decentralized, user-first AI tooling (GPT + modular LLM backends) enabling privacy-preserving inference and modular integrations.  
- Led brand and product rework to align technical architecture with a human-centered product vision and roadmapped features.  
- Performed whitehat pentests for mission-critical systems; recommendations contributed to an estimated **30% reduction in incidents**.  
- Optimized DoD portfolio allocations and compliance workflows — improving utilization by **~30%** and reducing select operational spend by **~15%**.  
- Managed large-scale operations to 95% on-time metrics and achieved +20% productivity improvements through targeted training and process redesign.

---

## Selected projects
- Decentralized AI Platform — orchestrated GPT + open LLM backends for user-controlled inference and secure data flows. (Tech: Python, Docker, Kubernetes, LLM orchestration)  
- Digital Governance Prototypes — interaction models and tokenized value-exchange frameworks for collaborative decision‑making.  
- Federal Portfolio Optimization — analytical frameworks for resource planning, compliance mapping, and cost reduction.

## Tools & tech
Python · PyTorch / TensorFlow · Transformers · Docker · Kubernetes · AWS / GCP · LLM toolkits · Threat modeling · Burp Suite · Agile · UX & product tooling

---

## How I work
- Security-first engineering with pragmatic trade-offs.  
- Prototype fast, validate with stakeholders, then iterate toward operational robustness.  
- Translate technical work into measurable operational outcomes and clear stakeholder value.

Next steps
- Confirm which of the meanings of “fix v” is correct, or confirm you want this README pushed.
- If you want me to push: tell me the target branch (main/default or a feature branch) and whether to open a PR.
- If you meant a different file or a version bump, give the file path or more context and I’ll prepare the change.
