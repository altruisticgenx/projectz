# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is AltruisticXAI?

AltruisticXAI is an ethical reflection engine that helps you make values-driven decisions. It's not a productivity tool or AI assistant that gives you answers‚Äîit's a calm space for reflection that helps you understand the ethical dimensions of your choices.

### How is this different from other AI tools?

Unlike ChatGPT or other AI assistants that provide answers or complete tasks, AltruisticXAI:
- Focuses on reflection, not productivity

## Privacy & Data Questions

### Where is my data stored?

Your reflections are stored **locally in your browser** by default. No data is sent to servers unless you explicitly choose cloud processing mode.

### What's the difference between Local and Cloud mode?

**Local Mode:**
- AI runs on your device (future feature)
- Completely private
- No internet connection needed (after initial load)
- Slower processing

**Cloud Mode:**
- AI runs on secure servers
- Faster processing
- Requires internet connection
- Data is encrypted in transit and not stored

### Can I export my data?

Yes! Click the Privacy icon (üõ°Ô∏è) and select "Export My Data". You'll receive a JSON file with all your reflections.

### Can I delete my data?

Absolutely. You have full control:
- Delete individual reflections from the Logbook
- Delete all data from the Privacy modal
- Your data is immediately and permanently removed

### Is my data shared or sold?

**Never.** Your personal reflections are private. We only collect anonymized, aggregated data with explicit user consent for improving the AI models‚Äîand even that is optional.

### Is AltruisticXAI GDPR compliant?

Yes. AltruisticXAI follows GDPR principles:
- Privacy by default
- User control over data
- Right to access and export
- Right to deletion
- Transparent data practices

## Usage Questions

### How do I start a reflection?

1. Type what's on your mind in the input field
2. The AI presents two options (binary choice)
3. Select the option that feels right
4. Review the Ripple feedback showing values affected
5. Save to your Logbook or start a new reflection

### What are "Ripple" choices?

Ripple choices are binary decisions that help you see:
- **Values Upheld**: What you're honoring with this choice
- **Values Strained**: What you're compromising
- **Potential Ripple**: Long-term implications

The name "Ripple" represents how every decision creates ripples in your life and values.

### What if neither option feels right?

That's valuable feedback! It might mean:
- The dilemma needs reframing
- There's a third path to explore
- You need more information
- Your values are in tension

You can start a new reflection to explore different angles.

### How many reflections can I save?

As many as you want! Reflections are stored in your browser's local storage, which typically has room for thousands of entries.

### Can I search my past reflections?

Currently, you can browse your reflection timeline chronologically. Search and filter features are planned for future releases.

### Can I share a reflection?

Individual reflections are private by design. Future features will include:
- Optional sharing with team members
- Anonymous sharing for collective insights
- Export to other tools (Notion, Obsidian, etc.)

## Philosophical Questions

### Why binary choices? Isn't life more complex?

You're right‚Äîlife is complex! But binary choices are powerful because they:
- Force clarity by eliminating "maybes"
- Reveal your true priorities
- Show which values matter most right now
- Are easier to reflect on than multiple options

Think of them as a tool for focusing your reflection, not a limitation.

### Isn't this just another "should I do X?" tool?

No! AltruisticXAI doesn't tell you what to do. It helps you:
- Understand your values
- See trade-offs clearly
- Reflect on implications
- Make your own decision

The goal is wisdom and self-awareness, not answers.

### What if I disagree with the AI's assessment?

Perfect! Disagreement is valuable data. It means:
- You know your values better than the AI
- You're thinking critically
- You're not just following recommendations

AltruisticXAI is a mirror, not an authority. Your judgment always comes first.

### Can AI really help with ethics?

AI can't make ethical decisions for you, but it can:
- Help you see patterns in your choices
- Present perspectives you hadn't considered
- Structure your thinking
- Remind you of your stated values

The reflection and decision are always yours.
