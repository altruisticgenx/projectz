# 👋 Hi — I’m Inga Kaltak
Building secure, human-first AI and decentralized systems that scale.

I’m a Machine Learning Engineer and systems architect with hands-on experience across AI/LLMs, decentralized architectures, penetration testing, and federal programs. I combine product instincts, security-first engineering, and policy-savvy strategy to deliver technology that is both useful and trustworthy.

## Quick snapshot
- Location: Philadelphia, PA (Hybrid / Remote)  
- Roles: ML Engineer · Systems Architect · Security Researcher · Federal Consultant  
- Core approach: human-centered design + measurable operational impact

---

## What I do (in one line)
I design and ship AI-driven systems and governance models that empower users, reduce risk, and unlock operational efficiencies for public- and private-sector organizations.

## Impact highlights

Machine Learning Engineer — Freelance · Philadelphia, PA
- Architected decentralized, user-first AI tools combining GPT and open-source LLMs to enable privacy-preserving workflows and modular integrations.
- Led brand- and product-level rework to align technical architecture with a human-centered product vision.
- Designed interaction models for digital governance and collaborative decision-making used in prototype and POC deployments.
- Helped originate NHPC intellectual property and technical strategy.

Penetration Tester — Defense Intelligence Agency & Lockheed Martin
- Performed whitehat penetration tests and threat emulation across mission-critical systems.
- Drove remediation guidance and stakeholder education that contributed to an estimated 30% reduction in security incidents.

Management Consulting Analyst — Accenture Federal Services
- Rebalanced DoD program portfolios and optimized resource allocation — improving utilization by ~30%.
- Built compliance and procurement frameworks for DLA; redesigned interfaces and content for energy.gov.
- Implemented cost-saving measures that reduced DoD operational spend by ~15%.

Business Analyst — SAP SuccessFactors
- Delivered ROI and workflow automation strategies that increased process efficiency by 30%.

Area Operations Manager — Amazon
- Managed operations for a large fulfillment node: 95% on-time delivery, workforce of 100+ associates, and +20% productivity improvements via targeted training programs.

## Featured projects (high level)
- Decentralized AI Platform — Integrated GPT + modular LLM backends for user-controlled inference and secure data flows. (Tech: Python, Docker, Kubernetes, LLM orchestration)
- Digital Governance Models — Prototyped collaboration frameworks and tokenized value-exchange systems for distributed decision-making.
- Federal Portfolio Optimization — Analytical frameworks and tools for resource planning, compliance mapping, and cost-reduction for federal clients.

## Selected wins
- Led multiple institutional POCs for AI-powered products that moved into operational pilots.
- Contributed to IP and product strategy for decentralized governance primitives.
- Reduced security incidents 30% through rigorous penetration testing and remediation.
- Enabled millions in savings across federal programs through process redesign and portfolio optimization.

## Tech & tools
Python · PyTorch/TensorFlow · Transformers & LLM toolkits · Docker · Kubernetes · AWS / GCP · Threat modeling · Burp Suite / pentest tooling · Agile / Scrum · Product design & UX fundamentals

## How I work
- Security-first engineering with pragmatic trade-offs.  
- Product-minded systems architecture: prototypes fast, iterate with stakeholders, and operationalize for scale.  
- Value-driven: I translate technical work into measurable operational outcomes.

## Looking to collaborate on
- Human-centered AI and governance primitives
