# 👋 Hi — I’m Inga Kaltak
Engineer, security researcher, and systems architect building human-first AI and decentralized systems that scale.

I design and ship production-ready ML & governance systems that prioritize privacy, resilience, and real-world impact. My work blends large-language-model engineering, decentralized architecture, red-team rigor, and federal program optimization — all guided by product sensibilities and measurable outcomes.

## Snapshot
- Location: Philadelphia, PA (Hybrid / Remote)  
- Roles: Machine Learning Engineer · Systems Architect · Security Researcher · Federal Consultant  
- Approach: human-centered design + security-first engineering + outcome-driven delivery

---

## What I build (one line)
AI-native systems and governance primitives that empower users, reduce operational risk, and unlock measurable efficiencies.

---

## Core strengths
- LLM integration & production ML (GPT + open-source models)  
- Decentralized systems & digital governance design  
- Penetration testing, threat emulation & security hardening  
- Federal program optimization, compliance, and stakeholder coordination  
- Product strategy, systems architecture, and operationalization

---

## Impact highlights
- Built decentralized, user-first AI tooling (GPT + modular LLM backends) enabling privacy-preserving inference and modular integrations.  
- Led brand + product rework to align technical architecture with a human-centered product vision and roadmapped features.  
- Performed whitehat pentests for mission-critical systems; recommendations contributed to an estimated **30% reduction in incidents**.  
- Optimized DoD portfolio allocations and compliance workflows — improving utilization by **~30%** and reducing select operational spend by **~15%**.  
- Managed large-scale operations to 95% on-time metrics and +20% productivity improvements through targeted training and process redesign.

---

## Selected projects
- Decentralized AI Platform — orchestrated GPT + open LLM backends for user-controlled inference and secure data flows. (Tech: Python, Docker, k8s, LLM orchestration)  
- Digital Governance Prototypes — interaction models and tokenized value-exchange frameworks for collaborative decision-making.  
- Federal Portfolio Optimization — analytical frameworks for resource planning, compliance mapping, and cost-reduction.

## Tools & tech
Python · PyTorch / TensorFlow · Transformers · Docker · Kubernetes · AWS / GCP · LLM toolkits · Threat modeling · Burp Suite · Agile · UX & product tooling

---

## How I work
- Security-first engineering with pragmatic trade-offs.  
- Prototype fast, validate with stakeholders, then iterate toward operational robustness.  
- Translate technical work into measurable operational outcomes and clear stakeholder value.

---

## Looking to collaborate
- Human-centered AI products and governance primitives  
- Privacy-preserving LLM integrations and tooling  
- Security assessments, red-team engagements, and remediation programs  
- Federal/DoD program optimization, compliance tooling, and portfolio analytics
