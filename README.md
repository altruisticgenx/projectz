# AltruisticXAI

**Reflect. Decide. Grow.**

AltruisticXAI is an AI-facilitated ethical reflection engine that helps individuals and teams make values-driven decisions with transparency and trust. Unlike traditional productivity tools, AltruisticXAI creates a calm, psychological "safe space" for reflection—guiding users through binary choices, explaining trade-offs, and building ethical clarity over time with radical privacy by default.

## What Makes AltruisticXAI Different

AltruisticXAI fills the modern gap in AI-driven ethical support. It's not a productivity bot—it's a reflection engine that:

1. Helps users clarify core values through binary "Ripple" choices
2. Explains trade-offs for every decision
3. Builds ethical clarity and self-awareness over time
4. Maintains radical privacy with user-controlled data
